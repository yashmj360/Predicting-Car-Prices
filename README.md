# Predicting-Car-Prices
In this project, we'll use the machine learning workflow to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.

Data can be directly downloaded from Machine Learning Repository and also attached in the same repository.
